## Overview
This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first Workflow


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Understood the differences between inline and block elements. Learned how to effectively style/center a button by changing its display type from inline to block. Learned how to effectively use hover states for interractive elements.


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on styling for responsiveness in future projects. 


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to understand the characteristcis of inline and block elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
